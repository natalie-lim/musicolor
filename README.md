# Musicolor

Musicolor takes a genre of music and generates a color palette from it using the thecolorapi.com!

## **Running This Project**
Check it out at this link: https://musicolor-xi.vercel.app/

## **Features**
1. **Dynamic Color Palette Generation**:
   - Creates color palettes using **The Color API**.
   - Displays genre-themed palettes with HEX codes for future reference.

2. **Genre-Based Themes**:
   - Includes pre-defined seed colors for all the different genres. (I picked three for each genre and each time you regenerate it randomizes which seed color is picked).

3. **Interactive UI**:
   - Animated dots in the background, each styled with a palette color that was generated form the API.
   - Intuitive design

4. **Palette Regeneration**:
   - Allows users to regenerate a new palette on demand, in case some are unsatisfactory.

## **Time spent**
... I'm not going to lie I spent a long time on this haha. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience with REACT or api calls so figuring out global state alone took me forever (I ended up using recoil atoms). I also wanted to something with the spotify api originally but unfortunately that required authentication that I couldn't quite get... and yet I still wasted a lot of time trying to figure it out smh. I would say this totalled to around 10 hours of work, but given how much I learned and how little experience I had before I think I could replicate it in a lot less.
